Immunichain Blockchain Lab
==========================

**How did Immunichain Come About?**

Immunichain came from an IBM internal Blockchain hackathon in early May of 2017. The hackathon generated an use case from an IBMer. Around the same time, an Open Mainframe Project intern Kevin Lee from Illinois University was tasked to make a website demonstrating the benefits of Blockchain of this use case. In early August at SHARE, he showcased his end product - which is what you are going to work with today!

**What are you going to accomplish today?**

The Hyperledger Composer Playground is way to produce Blockchain applications quickly without the heavy technical knowledge. In this lab, we will only be using the web version of Hyperledger Composer. If you were to install Hyperledger Composer on your local machine, you would gain more benefits - like deploying to Hyperledger Fabric and opening up your network to a REST server. Once in the Composer Playground, you will create the Blockchain application with a banana file (.bna) that will make up Immunichain. You will then create assets and participants. After that, we will submit transactions and see how the participants look after those transactions.

Part 1: Starting and Creating Your Hyperledger Composer Network
===============================================================

**1.** Go to this workshop's GitHub repository  https://github.com/silliman/BlockchainImmersion and download the Web_immunichain.bna and permissions.acl files.  **Tip:** Right-click on the link in this step and select *Open new tab* or *Open new window* so that these instructions stay open for as you are downloading these two files.

**2.** From your web browser, go to https://composer-playground.mybluemix.net/ -- this is the web version of Hyperledger Composer.

**3.** You will get a Welcome pop-up box with a graphic and a few words. Click on Let's Blockchain

.. image:: images/composer/1.1.png

**4.** Then you will be in the Composer Playground homepage. Click on Deploy a New Business Network.

**5.** You have to give a name for your Blockchain Network. Give it a description as well. Then finish off by dragging the Web_immunichain.bna file - that you downloaded - to the upload box.

.. image:: images/composer/1.2.png

**6.** Then click on Deploy 

**7.** Afterwards, you can come back to the Composer Playground play with some of the other sample business network applications, like animal tracking or vehicle lifecycles.

**8.** You will then be taken to Your Wallet. Your wallet is basically a quick, seamless connection to multiple connections that you can jump around with. You will see later how easy it is. Click on Connect now in order to get connected to your Immunichain network

.. image:: images/composer/1.3.png

**9.** After you have done that, your screen should look like this. If it does, then we are in business (get it? In business, business network - great!)

.. image:: images/composer/1.4.png

**What did you just accomplish?**

You went to the web version of Hyperledger Composer and imported the Immunichain Blockchain network. Then you connected to the network by way of the ID card in your Composer wallet. 

Part 2: Creating Assets and Participants
========================================

**1.** Now that you have an Immunichain Business Network, jump over to the Test section of the Composer Playground. The test area allows you to create assets, participants and submit transactions against your assets and participants. Your screen should look like this: 

.. image:: images/composer/2.1.png

Before we create assets and participants, we need to know what each asset and participants represent. 

*   Guardian is the parent
*   MedProvider is simply a medical provider, like a doctor
*   Childform is simply the child or the asset in this business network

**2.** Now create a Guardian by clicking on +Create New Participant. Give the Guardian a number. I stick to 1, 2, 3 or low numbers that you can remember, but you can create any ID number you want. I suggest writing your ID numbers down as we move along. Once you have filled in the information click on Create

.. image:: images/composer/2.2.png

.. image:: images/composer/2.3.png

**3.** Once you have created a Guardian, your screen should look like this: 

.. image:: images/composer/2.4.png

**5.** Go ahead and make a Medical Provider. Remember the Medical Provider number you create

.. image:: images/composer/2.5.png

**6.** Now, let's make a child. Click on optional properties at the bottom first. Assign him to the guardian you just created a step ago

.. image:: images/composer/2.6.png

**7.** Your screen should look like this when you are done:

.. image:: images/composer/2.7.png

**8.** Go ahead and create more medical providers, members, guardians and children. Just to remember to write down the ID numbers. This will make more sense when we submit transactions. 

**What did you just accomplish?**

You created various participants within the Composer Playground as well as assets, which are the children in this business network. 

Part 3: Adding Participants and Transactions
============================================

So far, everything has been a bit easy. Now, we are going to add a participant and some transaction code for that new participant. It is important to notice where I am adding in code in relation to the other lines of code.

**1.** Head into your model file by going to the Define section and clicking on the Model File

.. image:: images/composer/3.1.png

**2.** On line 15, add in this participant::

	participant Member identified by memid {
		o String memid
		o String name
	}

.. image:: images/composer/3.2.png

**3.** On line 35, add in this line in the asset childform::

	--> Member [] members optional

.. image:: images/composer/3.3.png

**4.** On line 47, add in this line in the transaction authMember::

	--> Member member

.. image:: images/composer/3.4.png

**5.** On line 54, add in this line in the transaction removeMemberAuth::

	--> Member member

.. image:: images/composer/3.5.png

**6.** Then click on Update, if successful you will get a success message in the top right

.. image:: images/composer/3.6.png

What other participants or assets could you see being added the Immunichain Blockchain network? Collaborate with a few people around you to gather ideas. Later you can add these participants and assets to your network. 

Now, let's add some transactions.

**7.** Switch to the Script File in the Define Section

.. image:: images/composer/3.7.png

**8.** On line 20, add in this transaction::

	/**
	 * Authorize member to child record
	 * @param {ibm.wsc.immunichain.authMember} authMember - the authMember transaction
	 * @transaction
	*/
	function authMember(authMember) {
	  var guardian = authMember.guardian;
	  var child = authMember.childform;
	  var member = authMember.member;
	  child.members.push(member);
	return getAssetRegistry('ibm.wsc.immunichain.Childform')
	  .then(function(ChildRegistry) {
		return ChildRegistry.update(child);
	  });
	}

.. image:: images/composer/3.8.png

**9.** On line 36, add in this transaction as well::

	/**
	* Deauthorize member to child record, so remove from members list
	* @param {ibm.wsc.immunichain.removeMemberAuth} removeMemberAuth - the removeMemberAuth transaction
	* @transaction
	*/
	function removeMemberAuth(removeMemberAuth) {
	  var guardian = removeMemberAuth.guardian;
	  var child = removeMemberAuth.childform;
	  var member = removeMemberAuth.member;
	  var mem = child.members;
	  var idx = mem.indexOf(member);

	//if the member is in the array of Members, we can remove it
	  if (idx !== -1){
		mem.splice(idx,1);
	}

	return getAssetRegistry('ibm.wsc.immunichain.Childform')
	  .then(function(result) {
		return result.update(child);
        });
	}

See picture below to get a sense of what to do.

.. image:: images/composer/3.9.png

**10.** Again, click on Update to update your Script File

**What did you just accomplish?**

What you just did was add in the participant named Member. Member is basically just an organization you want to grant access to your child's healthcare record. Think of granting a summer camp access to your child's healthcare record to make sure that they have taken all their shots or immunizations. Another way to think about this is having the High School Athletic Department as a member and they can tell that the athlete has passed their physical. You also created some transaction logic into your Script File, which is comprised of JavaScript. 

Part 4: Submitting Transactions
===============================

**1.** Now that we have a new participant, let's create a Member. Jump to the test section and click on Member on the left. 

.. image:: images/composer/4.1.png

**2.** Click on Create New Participant and follow the steps below to add a Member.

.. image:: images/composer/4.2.png

**3.** Then click on the pencil in the top right of our child's box.

.. image:: images/composer/4.3.png

**4.** Click on Optional Properties. You will notice the member section appearing now. Then click on Update.

.. image:: images/composer/4.4.png

**5.** Now, click on Submit Transaction and let's authorize a member to view the health record of our child. You can change the type of transaction you want by click on the middle grey box. I have it in a square below

.. image:: images/composer/4.5.png

**6.** Now, let's make an authorized member transaction. Here is my transaction. You can make any type of transaction you want here

.. image:: images/composer/4.6.png

My transaction says let member #1 (Fairmont High School) have Child #1's (Emily) health record. This would be extremely useful when every year thousands of kids get physicals in order to play a sport. Imagine having your medical provider authorize your child's health record to approve them playing a sport. I know my mom would've enjoyed not going up to the High School an additional time. 

**7.** You can view this transaction by clicking on childform on the left and then Show All on Emily. Notice that member 1 is now in Emily's description

.. image:: images/composer/4.7.png

**8.** Click on Submit Transaction in the bottom left.

**9.** A pop-up will appear with the transaction of assigning a Medical Provider to one of the children you've created

**10.** Now, replace the ID Numbers to replicate the guardian, medical provider and child. Look at the below picture to get a sense of what to do

.. image:: images/composer/4.8.png

That basically says, assign medical provider #1 (Healthquest) to Child #1 (Emily).

**11.** Click Submit once you have the ID Numbers you want

**12.** Once you submit the transaction and it is good, click on All Transactions in the bottom left. This is what Composer likes to call the Historian. Now is a good time to tell you about the Historian. The Historian is the sequence of transactions or addition or removal of participants or assets. I didn't tell you to look at the Historian when you were creating the Participants and Assets, but the Historian kept track of when and what type of participant or asset you created. You can scroll to the bottom to view the first transaction you created, which should be the Medical Provider - HealthQuest - or whatever you called it. You can see by clicking on view record. 

.. image:: images/composer/4.9.png

**13.** Back to our transaction, click on the Childform on the left. Find the child you assigned a Medical Provider to. Click on Show All to view the entire asset of your child. Notice the medical provider you assigned it to? 

.. image:: images/composer/4.10.png

**14.** Should we do another transaction? Of course! 

**15.** We have submitted some transactions, but now let's actually add some immunizations to a child

**16.** Click on Submit Transaction and then change the transaction type to addImmunizations. The format to add an immunization is a little different. In the Vaccine section put { "name" : "immunization", "provider" : "medical provider", "imdate" : "date" } inbetween the brackets. Replace the immunization, medical provider and date with whatever you would like. Here is what my transaction looks like::

	{ "name" : "immunization", "provider" : "medical provider", "imdate" : "date" }

.. image:: images/composer/4.11.png

**17.** To view your immunization, go your child in the Childform section

.. image:: images/composer/4.12.png

**18.** Continue to make various transactions that you want

**What did you just accomplish?**

You submitted transactions against participants and the assets within Composer. You understand the value of authorizing members, such as various high school athletics or even summer camps. Most importantly, you added Immunizations to your child, which is the whole point of Immunichain. 

Part 5: Modifying Permissions
=============================

If you were to go to the permissions.acl file in the Define section, you would notice how any participant can do anything that they want to the network. This doesn't actually replicate what would happen in a real Immunichain business network. In this section we are going to change the permissions to the business network. You will notice these permissions by submitting transactions with the various participant identities you are about to create. 

**1.** Go to the Define section of Composer Playground. Then click on admin in the top right. Then click on ID Registry

.. image:: images/composer/5.1.png

**2.** We are doing great if this is what your page looks like

.. image:: images/composer/5.2.png

**3.** Click on Issue New ID

**4.** A pop-up will appear. Give your identity a name (disclaimer: the identity will be tied to a participant you created earlier in the lab; ie: Guardian Austin, Medical Provider HealthQuest). Then type in the number 1. You should now see the various participants that have an ID number of 1. If you gave your participants a different ID number, you won't see anything by typing in 1. Instead, type in the number you gave to your participants. Here is what I did below:

.. image:: images/composer/5.3.png

**5.** If your screen looks like this, then we are in good shape

.. image:: images/composer/5.4.png

**6.** Go ahead and create other identities for your participants

**7.** I have a total of 4 identities in my business network. Here is what my screen looks like. You could have more identities if you created more, depending on how many participants your created in Part 2

.. image:: images/composer/5.5.png

**8.** Since we are in the admin identity (make sure you see admin in the top right), lets change our permissions file. Click on Define and then Access Control in the bottom left.

.. image:: images/composer/5.6.png

**9.** Open up the permissions.acl file that you downloaded from Github. Select all and copy the content in that file. 

.. image:: images/composer/5.7.png

**10.** Then paste that content above the other commands in the Access Control file. Here is what I my screen looks like now:

.. image:: images/composer/5.8.png

**11.** Once you are good to go, click on Update in the bottom left and that will make changes across the entire business network. Read through some of the rules that we just implemented. What do you think will change as we go through the various identities?

.. image:: images/composer/5.9.png

**12.** Click on admin in the top right again. This time, click on My Business Networks. This will take us to the Composer Playground homepage

**13.** Now your screen should look like this:

.. image:: images/composer/5.10.png

When you created the identities, Composer was creating ID Cards for those identities. That is why I have 4 ID Cards. They are all tied to the Immunichain business network and to the participants you created in Part 2. You could think of this as a 4 peer Blockchain network, with 1 of the peers being an admin who oversees the entire network. 

**14.** Go ahead and click on Connect Now with your Guardian ID.

.. image:: images/composer/5.11.png

**15.** You are now in the Guardian's perspective in the Immunichain business network. Go ahead and click on the other participants in the Test section

Medical Providers:

.. image:: images/composer/5.12.png

Members: 

.. image:: images/composer/5.13.png

Child: 

.. image:: images/composer/5.14.png

What did you notice about the permissions here? From the Guardian perspective, you can view all the Medical Providers, Members and Children that the Guardian has ownership of. 

**16.** Go ahead and update your Child by clicking on the pencil in the top right. Delete the Medical Providers and Members

.. image:: images/composer/5.15.png

.. image:: images/composer/5.16.png

**17.** Submit transaction from the Guardian perspective. Start with assigning a Medical Provider. 

.. image:: images/composer/5.17.png

**18.** Submit another transaction by assigning a Member

.. image:: images/composer/5.18.png

From the Guardian perspective, you are able to do a lot of different things. First, you can view the Children in the network that the Guardian has ownership of. Also, the guardian can create additional children with the way the permissions are set up. Do you think this is a viable option in a production environment? I would say no, but you can have the Medical Provider, who administered the birth of the Child, create the Child asset. In a production environment, this would be negotiated between all the participants in the business network. Also, as the Guardian you can also view all the Members and Medical Providers. Why do you think that is so? When you have a child as a guardian you want to be able to view all the options you have as possible Medical Providers and Members. In a real-world scenario, maybe the Guardian would only view and allow all the Medical Providers that are tied to their Health Insurance, but that would require an Insurer in this Immunichain business network. Maybe in the future :) 

**19.** I think you're getting the sense from the Guardian perspective. Before we jump to another perspective, delete all Members. You previously did this from step 16 in this part. Once you have successfully done that, go ahead and switch to the Medical Provider perspective. Click on My Business Networks in the top right. Then click on Connect Now on the Medical Provider

.. image:: images/composer/5.19.png

**20.** Click around on the other participants in the Immunichain Business Network

Guardian: 

.. image:: images/composer/5.20.png

Members:

.. image:: images/composer/5.21.png

Child: 

.. image:: images/composer/5.22.png

**21.** Click on Submit Transaction. Start with assigning a Member

.. image:: images/composer/5.23.png

**22.** Now, create another Child asset. Have the Child's guardian be the first Guardian. In my business network, this would be Guardian Austin. 

.. image:: images/composer/5.24.png

.. image:: images/composer/5.25.png

If you noticed, I now have TWINS! My life suddenly got crazy for a 23-year-old. I guess I need to continue work in order to support them. Or just become a crypto-currency millionaire (I don't know if that's possible these days). 

On a slightly more serious note, maybe having the Medical Provider create additional children isn't the best idea. It really depends on who the Medical Provider is. Is it the hospital? Or more specifically, is the Medical Provider the doctor who works in the baby delivery department of the hospital? Should the Medical Provider be able to create the child, or should we leave it up to the Guardians to create the children? These types of conversations have to occur between the peers in the business network if this was to be a production environment. 

**23.** Great, we just created another Child. Jump back over to the Guardian perspective. Did the new Child show up? 

.. image:: images/composer/5.26.png

**24.** Go ahead and only assign a Medical Provider to the new Child by submitting a transaction 

**25.** Should we jump to the Member perspective? Absolutely! 

.. image:: images/composer/5.27.png

**26.** Look around at the various participants in the Immunichain business network

Child: 

.. image:: images/composer/5.28.png

**27.** If you noticed, all the children showed up. Click on Show All on the Bobbie, you notice that this member isn't listed as one her authorized Members.

.. image:: images/composer/5.29.png

Is this a good thing - that Bobbie appeared to this member? Absolutely not. This would be a non-negotiable in the business network. You wouldn't want a Member to be able to see a Child, unless it has authorization. Could you imagine a Member being able to read all the Immunization records of every Child? We have to modify the permissions in our Access Control file. 

See if you can modify the rule in the Access Control file in the Define section. 

**What did you just accomplish?**

In this section you modified the permissions for the Immunichain business network. Once you added a few rules, you created various identities for the participants you created earlier in this lab. Based off the new permissions you were either able to successfully or unsuccessfully submit transactions and create assets. Also, we brought up good questions around security and what participant can do what in the Immunichain business network. 

**End of Lab!**
